did it send?
g4dn.xlarge
c6g.medium
c5.large


Instance types
 - Will not use the gpu one because cannot find an instance type to use and all are pricey anyway.
 - cheapest accelerate compute is inf1.xlarge
 - g4dn.xlarge is another cheap one.
 - will run using t3.medium
 - but use g4dn.xlarge/inf1.xlarge or faster for presentation.
